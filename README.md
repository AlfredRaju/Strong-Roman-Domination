# Strong-Roman-Domination
The repository provides codes for solving the strong Roman domination problem in graphs using different metaheuristics viz. genetic algorithm, artificial bee colony algorithm and modified differential evolution algorithm.
The codes uses two different procedures which differ in heuristics to solve the problem.
